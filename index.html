	<p style="font-family:sans-serif;" align="left">My name is Laura and I'm new to this whole coding business. I'm also pretty new to this city of Chicago, and this Country of the USA! As you may be able to tell, I'm a jump right in kind of person. The only fear of change I possess is the fear that the change will not come. I've always loved reinvention. Perhaps thats part of what drew me to this line of work. Nothing changes faster, or is guareenteed to change as much as technology.</p>

    <p style="font-family:sans-serif;" align="left">When I'm not desperatly searching around for the way to plug into the matrix and absorbe all this coding language, I spend my time researching the one thing that will be my assured forever home, the Human body. I love/ am obsessed over knowing how the food we eat, and the things we absorb through our skin effect our bodies and the way we experience the world. It's a never ending discovery and as much as I try I just can't seem to say no to the next nutrition book. I think that's my true version of netflix and chill.</p>
